#### My attempt to build a stable ecommerce platform using the "MEAN" stack.
This repository's structure *should* be pretty self-explanatory:
- `/` - The root of the project, nothing interesting here.
- `/Server` - Contains all of the server-side logic for the application.
- `/Client` - Contains all of the client-side logic for the application.

I'm going to do my try and include a `README` in each major directory to help break things down and make it easier to understand (this helps me make sure I know what's going on, and may help somebody else learn something new.)

This project is not going to consist of anything spectacular, it is merely my attempt to build an ecommerce platform using the "MEAN" stack.
